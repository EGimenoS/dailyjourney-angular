Demo of the application: <https://dailyjourney.netlify.app> (bear in mind that most of the fake trips to try the app are around Valencia, ES!)

Repository of the API backend: <https://github.com/EGimenoS/dailyjourneyapi>

## Introduction

This is my Master's Dissertation app for the "Master in web applications development" of the UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya).  
The project goal is to put people in contact in order to share their cars for their daily travels, such as commuting to go to their workplaces.  
This repository contains the frontend part of the application, an Angular SPA. There is also a full-fledged backend made with Ruby on Rails as api-only mode that can be found here: [DailyJourney API](https://github.com/EGimenoS/dailyjourneyapi)

A demo of the application is hosted here: <https://dailyjourney.netlify.app>
